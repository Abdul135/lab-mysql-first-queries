#### 7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.

"""" Most of the aps come from the following categories (Social, Games, Music) and have a + 100K ratings """""


#### 8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.

"""" Most of the apps don't have enough number of ratings (some of them have below 10K ratings)""""


#### 9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?

"""" Looking at the results in both questions, 
we notice that the apps with the highest number of ratings 
are very different from the top rated apps. I think it is misleading to look at the top rated apps 
without adding some sort of a filter to the query; for example, looking at the top rated apps that have > 500K number of ratings"""""
